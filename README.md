# CoEdit: Real-Time Docs with Git Superpowers

A real-time collaborative document platform built in 24 hours. SyncScribe combines the seamless editing of Google Docs with robust, Git-like version control‚Äîso teams can edit, commit, and roll back changes effortlessly.

---

## üéØ The Problem

Traditional document collaboration means emailing versions back and forth‚Äîleading to confusion, conflicting edits, and lost change history. Most platforms lack powerful version control, making it tough for professional teams to manage important docs (project proposals, specs, contracts) with confidence.

## ‚ú® Our Solution

SyncScribe is your single source of truth. Multiple users edit the same doc in real time, with live cursors and changes for everyone.

**Killer feature:** Built-in version control. At any point, commit the current doc with a message‚Äîcreating a permanent snapshot. Browse history and instantly roll back to any previous version.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Real-Time Collaborative Editing:** Multiple users type and edit simultaneously, powered by Y.js CRDTs.
- **User Presence & Cursors:** See who‚Äôs in the doc and where their cursor is‚Äîjust like Google Docs.
- **Git-like Version Control:**
  - **Commit:** Save a snapshot of the doc with a message.

  - **Rollback:** Instantly revert to any previous commit.

- **Modern & Responsive UI:** Built with Shadcn/UI and Tailwind CSS for a clean, intuitive experience.
