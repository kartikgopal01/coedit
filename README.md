# CoEdit — Real‑Time Collaborative Docs with Version Control

Live Deployment - [coedit.vercel.app](https://coedit-uudn.vercel.app/)

CoEdit is a real‑time collaborative document platform with built‑in version control. Teams can edit together, save snapshots with commit messages, browse version history, analyze diffs with AI, and roll back instantly. It’s Google‑Docs‑style collaboration with Git‑like superpowers.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Real‑time editing (Quill + Firestore):** Low‑latency collaboration with presence and live cursors.
- **Presence cursors with names:** Each collaborator’s cursor shows their display name and color.
- **Snapshots with commit messages:** Save any state with a label; stored in S3 for durability.
- **Version history and rollback:** Browse historical snapshots, preview diff analysis, and revert.
- **AI helpers:**
  - Document summarization (`/api/ai/summarize`)
  - AI diff explanations for versions (`/api/ai/diff`)
  - Speech‑to‑Text uploads (`/api/ai/transcribe`)
- **Share & invites:** Generate share keys, join by key, and manage invites.
- **PDF export:** Save a snapshot and export that exact snapshot to PDF with consistent layout.
- **Polished UI:** Shadcn/UI + Tailwind; responsive, dark‑mode ready.

---

## 🧱 Architecture

- **Next.js App Router** for both UI and API routes
- **Auth:** Clerk (user identity + session)
- **Editor:** Quill (client‑side), Firestore for document state
- **Presence:** Firestore `documents/{id}/presence` subcollection
- **Snapshots:** JSON deltas stored in AWS S3; metadata in Firestore `documents/{id}/versions`
- **AI:** Server routes calling GROQ models for summarize/diff and a transcription endpoint

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A Firebase project with Firestore enabled
- An AWS S3 bucket (and credentials)
- A Clerk application (for auth)

### Environment Variables

Use `.env.local`. See the full guide in `ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md`. Summary:

```bash
# Clerk
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=

# Firebase (client)
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=

# Firebase Admin (service account)
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY={...json...}

# AWS S3
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
AWS_REGION=
AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME=

# AI
GROQ_API_KEY=
```

### Install and Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000
```

Optional scripts:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
npm run lint       # biome check
npm run lint:fix   # biome check --write
npm run type-check # tsc --noEmit
```

## 🧭 Core Flows

### Authentication
- Clerk guards server routes; client uses `<SignedIn/>` / `<SignedOut/>` and `useAuth()`.

### Editing & Presence
- `FirebaseEditor.tsx` initializes Quill and syncs doc state to Firestore (`documents/{id}`) as `deltaOps`.
- Presence is written to `documents/{id}/presence/{userId}` with `{ name, color, index, length }`.

### Snapshots & Version History
- Saving snapshot: `POST /api/documents/{id}/snapshot` with `{ delta, commitMessage }`.
- Metadata saved to Firestore `documents/{id}/versions` and JSON delta to S3.
- `VersionHistory.tsx` lists versions, opens AI diff modal, and supports revert.

### AI
- Summarize: `POST /api/ai/summarize` → `{ summary }` (Markdown supported in UI)
- Diff explain: `POST /api/ai/diff` → `{ analysis }` (Markdown rendered)
- Transcribe: `POST /api/ai/transcribe` (multipart `file`) → `{ text }`

### Sharing & Invites
- Generate share link: `POST /api/documents/{id}/share` → `{ shareKey }`
- Join with key: `POST /api/documents/{id}/join-with-key` with `{ key }`
- Owner pending invites: `GET /api/documents/{id}/invites/pending`
- Invite collaborator: `POST /api/documents/{id}/invite` with `{ email }`

### PDF Export
- Download button prompts to save a snapshot (with message) and then downloads that exact snapshot as a PDF.
- If no unsaved changes, you can also export the latest snapshot.

## 🔌 API Quick Reference

Examples use `curl` and assume you’re authenticated via cookies in the browser; for local testing, call from the UI or attach session cookies.

Summarize:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ai/summarize \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"Your content here"}'
```

Analyze diff:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ai/diff \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"currentText":"...","previousText":"...","meta":{"versionId":"abc"}}'
```

Save snapshot:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/documents/DOC_ID/snapshot \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"delta": {"ops":[{"insert":"Hello"}]}, "commitMessage":"Init"}'
```

Presign download for snapshot:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/download \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"fileKey":"snapshots/.../snapshot-....json"}'
```

## 🔐 Notes on Security & Limits

- Ensure Firestore rules and S3 IAM policies restrict access appropriately in production.
- Current AI routes call GROQ; set `GROQ_API_KEY` in your environment.
- The app is optimized for hackathon speed; add rate limiting, input validation, and error handling as needed for production.

## 🧭 Roadmap Ideas

- Role‑based permissions (owner, editor, viewer)
- Inline comments and suggestions
- Advanced diff views (word/character level)
- Offline edits and conflict visualization
